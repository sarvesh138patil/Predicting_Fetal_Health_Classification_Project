# Predicting_Fetal_Health_Classification_Project

* Utilized Python and pandas to analyze a fetal health classification dataset, implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree classifiers.
* Faced challenges in optimizing model performance due to imbalanced data distribution and feature selection complexities.
* Implemented techniques like oversampling, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning to address data imbalance and enhance model accuracy.
* Achieved significant improvement in fetal health prediction accuracy, leading to better patient outcomes and healthcare decision-making.
